# NioFlex
Flexible NIO Server Building-Blocks for Java

NioFlex allows developers to quickly create NIO-driven servers, which typically
require a lot more work than traditional blocking I/O servers.

NioFlex makes it so that you don't have to write low-level, boilerplate NIO code,
rather you can focus on the server functionality

The current version of NioFlex is 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.

**Examples:**

1. Simple NIO-driven Echo server
   * [DeployServer.java](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/NioFlex/blob/master/src/test/java/DeployServer.java)
   * [EchoServer.java](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/NioFlex/blob/master/src/test/java/com/inixsoftware/nioflex/examples/echo/EchoServer.java)
   * [EchoClient.java](https://github.com/maheshkhanwalkar/NioFlex/blob/master/src/test/java/com/inixsoftware/nioflex/examples/echo/EchoClient.java)
