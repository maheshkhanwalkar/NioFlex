# NioFlex
Flexible NIO Server Building-Blocks for Java

NioFlex allows developers to quickly create NIO-driven servers, which typically
require a lot more work than traditional blocking I/O servers.

NioFlex makes it so that you don't have to write low-level, boilerplate NIO code,
rather you can focus on the server functionality

The current version of NioFlex is 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.
