# NioFlex
Flexible NIO Server Building-Blocks for Java

NioFlex allows developers to quickly create NIO-driven servers allowing for better scalability
than traditional blocking I/O servers. 

The simple-to-use API allows rapid development that is hassle-free. It allows you to simply
"plug" in code that is executed when a condition is met. 

The current version of NioFlex is 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
